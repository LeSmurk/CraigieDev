*My 4th year Honours project researching simulating soft-body dynamics in real-time.*

Using Spring/Mass principles, I am attemping to simulate soft-body physics within a games context and therefore placing a focus on the performance of the simulation within real-time. While I am using the Unity3D engine, I have only used the collision and transform components that come with the engine to create the current Spring/Mass system as I am researching how Entity Component Systems can be used to improve the performance of this soft body system.
