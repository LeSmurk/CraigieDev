I am a Gameplay Programmer at MachineGames with a Bsc with Honours in 'Computer Games Technology' from Abertay University.

After high-school, I moved from Edinburgh to Dundee to begin my studies at Abertay university, where - over the course of 4 years - I learned to become efficient in C++ and C# coding. After university I started as a junior programmer at Ubisoft Reflections, working on "Tom Clancy's The Division 2" as part of an engine team. I worked on various lower-level engine and platform-specific features before realising that I wanted to develop more gameplay programming skills. I moved to a new project to be part of a gameplay specific team in April 2020 before then being promoted to a 'Gameplay Programmer' a few months later. After moving to Sweden to work at MachineGames, I have been working on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle as a gameplay programmer since May 2022.

Other purely objective facts about me:
- Efficent communicator: I really enjoy and value working as part of a multi-disciplinary team
- Adaptable: I have worked on numerious game engines and projects with different styles and demands
- Strong programmer: Ontop of my 4 years of studying, I have been programming in C++ for 5.5 years professionally
- Eye for design: A passion for video games has made me enjoy the creative side of gameplay programming, identifying and tackling problems however they arise.
