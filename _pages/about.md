I am a Gameplay Programmer at Ubisoft Reflections with a Bsc with Honours in 'Computer Games Technology' from Abertay University.

After high-school, I moved from Edinburgh to Dundee to begin my studies at Abertay university, where - over the course of 4 years - I learned to become efficient in C++ and C# coding. After university I started as a junior programmer at Ubisoft Reflections, working on "Tom Clancy's The Division 2" as part of an engine team. I worked on various lower-level engine and platform-specific features before realising that I wanted to develop more gameplay programming skills. I moved to a new project to be part of a gameplay specific team in April 2020 before then being promoted to a 'Gameplay Programmer' a few months later. Due to my love for video games, I have developed games as part of my current work, during university coursework and outside in my spare time either within a group or just as smaller solo projects. I really value good communication and enjoy working as part of a team.
