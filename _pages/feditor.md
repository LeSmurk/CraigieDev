*A game releasing on Steam at the start of February, made during my 2018/19 winter holiday*

A game made within a month entirely solo as a passion project to be able to say that I released my own game. Made with Unity as a 2.5D PC mouse-clicker game inspired by Twitch and youtube creator "Fedmyster" in a month during my winter holidays of 2018-2018. The main aim of this project was to make something I could manage within a short time entirely by myself and that could be released as a portfolio piece. 

Feditor will be available on Steam on the 3rd of February 2019.
