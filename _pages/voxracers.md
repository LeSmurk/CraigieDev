This project is currently still in development, and will be properly released sometime in the future.

After the initial prototype created during the 2018 global game jam, I entered the Abertay Dare Academy with my team where we became one of the finalists and had a booth at EGX Birmingham 2018 to demo the game.

I programmed the physics systems behind the movement of the racer and the interactables within the game such as collision/respawn and pickups. As we were a small team I also did a large amount of design as well as implementing game assets and developing the character select tools.

A full gameplay video of the track made can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whI2TQzA-aQ&feature=youtu.be
